/**
 * How to Use Frame — the guide's content (how-to-use-frame-guide spec).
 *
 * Pure data plus the helpers that read it: no electron, no DOM, no lucide at
 * require time, so `npm test` loads it in CI without `npm ci` (the Testing
 * record's convention — test the pure module, not its DOM host). The modal
 * (guideModal.js) renders it; the illustrations (guide/guideSketches.js)
 * draw each page's `sketch`.
 *
 * Shape:
 *   CHAPTERS → [{ id, title, pages }]
 *   page     → { id, title, sketch: { kind, focus? }, claudeOnly?, blocks, actions? }
 *   block    → exactly one of { p } | { list: [..] } | { code } | { note }
 *   action   → { id, label, stay? }
 *
 * Text is plain — never HTML. Two inline tokens are expanded by the host
 * after escaping:
 *   {kbd:<commandId>}  the command's current shortcut, read from the command
 *                      registry and formatted for the platform, so a page can
 *                      never quote a shortcut the app no longer has
 *   `code`             a path, a file name or a literal command
 *
 * Every command a page cites — as an action or a {kbd:} token — must be in
 * ACTION_IDS; `stay` (run without closing the guide) only on STAY_IDS, the
 * commands whose effect is visible in the guide itself. validate() checks
 * all of it and the test pins it.
